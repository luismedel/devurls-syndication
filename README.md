# *urls syndication

This utility started as an RSS feed generator for [devurls.com](https://devurls.com). The site is neat, and the curation of sites it's OK, but I really prefer to use an RSS reader 🤷🏻‍♂️.

Now it also syndicates feeds from all sibling sites:

- [devurls.com](https://devurls.com/)
- [techurls.com](https://techurls.com/)
- [sciurls.com](https://sciurls.com/)
- [mathurls.com](https://mathurls.com/)
- [hwurls.com](https://hwurls.com/)
- [finurls.com](https://finurls.com/)
- [physurls.com](https://physurls.com/)
- [tuxurls.com](https://tuxurls.com/)

The feeds are refreshed hourly via Github Actions and are available at [https://luismedel.github.io/devurls-syndication/](https://luismedel.github.io/devurls-syndication/). Feel free to subscribe to any of them or bulk-import directly with the included OPML.
